## Usage

```javascript
var flipud = require( '@stdlib/ndarray/flipud' );
```

#### flipud( x )

Returns a read-only view of an input [`ndarray`][@stdlib/ndarray/ctor] in which the order of elements along the second-to-last dimension is reversed.

```javascript
var array = require( '@stdlib/ndarray/array' );

var x = array( [ 1.0, 2.0, 3.0, 4.0, 5.0, 6.0 ], {
    'shape': [ 3, 2 ]
});
// returns <ndarray>[ [ 1.0, 2.0 ], [ 3.0, 4.0 ], [ 5.0, 6.0 ] ]

var y = flipud( x );
// returns <ndarray>[ [ 5.0, 6.0 ], [ 3.0, 4.0 ], [ 1.0, 2.0 ] ]

{{alias}}()
    Returns a list of ndarray casting modes.

    The output array contains the following modes:

    - 'none': only allow casting between identical types.
    - 'equiv': allow casting between identical and byte swapped types.
    - 'safe': only allow "safe" casts.
    - 'mostly-safe': allow "safe" casts and, for floating-point data types,
      downcasts.
    - 'same-kind': allow "safe" casts and casts within the same kind (e.g.,
      between signed integers or between floats).
    - 'unsafe': allow casting between all types (including between integers and
      floats).

    Returns
    -------
    out: Array<string>
        List of ndarray casting modes.

    Examples
    --------
    > var out = {{alias}}()
    [ 'none', 'equiv', 'safe', 'mostly-safe', 'same-kind', 'unsafe' ]

{{alias}}( ndims, x, dims )
    Returns a read-only view of an input ndarray where the dimensions of the
    input ndarray are expanded to a specified dimensionality by spreading
    dimensions to specified dimension indices and inserting dimensions of size
    one for the remaining dimensions.

    Parameters
    ----------
    ndims: integer
        Number of dimensions in the output ndarray. Must be greater than or
        equal to the number of dimensions in the input ndarray.

    x: ndarray
        Input ndarray.

    dims: ArrayLikeObject<integer>
        Dimension indices at which to spread array dimensions. Must resolve to
        normalized indices arranged in ascending order. If provided an integer
        less than zero, the dimension index is resolved relative to the last
        dimension, with the last dimension corresponding to the value `-1`.

    Returns
    -------
    out: ndarray
        A read-only view of an input ndarray where the dimensions of the input
        ndarray are expanded to a specified dimensionality.

    Examples
    --------
    > var x = {{alias:@stdlib/ndarray/array}}( [ [ 1, 2 ], [ 3, 4 ] ] )
    <ndarray>[ [ 1, 2 ], [ 3, 4 ] ]
    > var y = {{alias}}( 3, x, [ 0, 1 ] )
    <ndarray>[ [ [ 1 ], [ 2 ] ], [ [ 3 ], [ 4 ] ] ]

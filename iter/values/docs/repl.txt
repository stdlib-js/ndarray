{{alias}}( x[, options] )
    Returns an iterator which returns individual elements from a provided
    ndarray.

    If an environment supports Symbol.iterator, the returned iterator is
    iterable.

    If an environment supports Symbol.iterator, the function explicitly does not
    invoke an ndarray's `@@iterator` method, regardless of whether this method
    is defined.

    Parameters
    ----------
    x: ndarray
        Input array.

    options: Object (optional)
        Options.

    options.order: string (optional)
        Index iteration order. By default, the returned iterator returns values
        according to the layout order of the provided array. Accordingly, for
        row-major input arrays, the last dimension indices increment fastest.
        For column-major input arrays, the first dimension indices increment
        fastest. To override the inferred order and ensure that indices
        increment in a specific manor, regardless of the input array's layout
        order, explicitly set the iteration order. Note, however, that iterating
        according to an order which does not match that of the input array may,
        in some circumstances, result in performance degradation due to cache
        misses. Must be either 'row-major' or 'column-major'.

    Returns
    -------
    iterator: Object
        Iterator.

    iterator.next(): Function
        Returns an iterator protocol-compliant object containing the next
        iterated value (if one exists) and a boolean flag indicating whether the
        iterator is finished.

    iterator.return( [value] ): Function
        Finishes an iterator and returns a provided value.

    Examples
    --------
    > var x = {{alias:@stdlib/ndarray/array}}( [ [ 1, 2 ], [ 3, 4 ] ] );
    > var it = {{alias}}( x );
    > var v = it.next().value
    1
    > v = it.next().value
    2

## Usage

```javascript
var atleastnd = require( '@stdlib/ndarray/base/atleastnd' );
```

#### atleastnd( ndims, arrays )

Converts a list of values (scalars and/or ndarrays) to ndarrays having at least a specified number of dimensions.

```javascript
var array = require( '@stdlib/ndarray/array' );

var x = array( [ [ [ 1.0, 2.0 ] ], [ [ 3.0, 4.0 ] ] ] );
// returns <ndarray>[ [ [ 1.0, 2.0 ] ], [ [ 3.0, 4.0 ] ] ]

var y = array( [ [ 5.0, 6.0 ], [ 7.0, 8.0 ] ] );
// returns <ndarray>[ [ 5.0, 6.0 ], [ 7.0, 8.0 ] ]

var out = atleastnd( 3, [ x, y ] );
// returns [ <ndarray>, <ndarray> ]
```

The function accepts the following arguments:

-   **ndims**: minimum number of dimensions.
-   **arrays**: array-like object containing a list of scalars and/or ndarrays.

## Notes

-   If a provided ndarray has fewer dimensions than `ndims`, the returned ndarray is a view on the input ndarray data buffer. The view is typically **not** contiguous. As more than one element of a returned view may refer to the same memory location, writing to the view may affect multiple elements. If you need to write to the returned ndarray, copy the ndarray **before** performing operations which may mutate elements.

-   The returned ndarray is a "base" [ndarray][@stdlib/ndarray/base/ctor], and, thus, the returned [ndarray][@stdlib/ndarray/base/ctor] does not perform bounds checking or afford any of the guarantees of the non-base [ndarray][@stdlib/ndarray/ctor] constructor. The primary intent of this function is to broadcast an ndarray-like object within internal implementations and to do so with minimal overhead.

-   If provided a scalar value (i.e., a non-ndarray) and that value

    -   is a number, the returned ndarray will have the [default][@stdlib/ndarray/defaults] real-valued floating-point data type.
    -   is a boolean, the returned ndarray will have the [default][@stdlib/ndarray/defaults] boolean data type.
    -   is a complex number object of a known data type, the data type of the returned ndarray will be the same as the provided value.
    -   is a complex number object of an unknown data type, the returned ndarray will have the [default][@stdlib/ndarray/defaults] complex-valued floating-point data type.
    -   is any other value type, the returned ndarray will have a `'generic'` data type.

## Examples

<!-- eslint no-undef: "error" -->

```javascript
var discreteUniform = require( '@stdlib/random/discrete-uniform' );
var ndarray2array = require( '@stdlib/ndarray/to-array' );
var atleastnd = require( '@stdlib/ndarray/base/atleastnd' );

var x = discreteUniform( [ 2, 2, 2 ], -100, 100 );
// returns <ndarray>

var y = discreteUniform( [ 5, 2 ], -100, 100 );
// returns <ndarray>

var out = atleastnd( 3, [ x, y ] );
// returns [ <ndarray>, <ndarray> ]

console.log( ndarray2array( out[ 0 ] ) );
console.log( ndarray2array( out[ 1 ] ) );
```

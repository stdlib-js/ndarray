{{alias}}( x, copy )
    Returns the shape of a provided ndarray.

    Parameters
    ----------
    x: ndarray
        Input ndarray.

    copy: boolean
        Boolean indicating whether to explicitly copy the value assigned to the
        input ndarray's `shape` property. When `copy` is `false`, changes to the
        returned shape array may mutate the input ndarray shape. If there is a
        chance that the returned shape will be mutated (either directly or by
        downstream consumers), set `copy` to `true` to prevent unintended side
        effects.

    Returns
    -------
    out: Array<integer>
        Shape.

    Examples
    --------
    > var out = {{alias}}( {{alias:@stdlib/ndarray/zeros}}( [ 3, 3, 3 ] ), false )
    [ 3, 3, 3 ]

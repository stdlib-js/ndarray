{{alias}}( x, value )
    Broadcasts a scalar value to an ndarray having the same shape and data type
    as a provided input ndarray.

    Along with data type, shape, and order, the function infers the "class" of
    the returned ndarray from the provided ndarray. For example, if provided a
    "base" ndarray, the function returns a base ndarray. If provided a non-base
    ndarray, the function returns a non-base ndarray.

    If `value` is a number and a provided ndarray has a complex number data
    type, the function returns an ndarray containing a complex number whose real
    component equals the provided scalar value and whose imaginary component is
    zero.

    The returned ndarray is a view on a single-element buffer. The returned
    ndarray is not contiguous. As more than one element of a returned ndarray
    refers to the same memory location, writing to the returned ndarray may
    affect multiple elements. If you need to write to the returned ndarray, copy
    the ndarray before performing operations which may mutate elements.

    Parameters
    ----------
    x: ndarray
        Input array.

    value: any
        Scalar value.

    Returns
    -------
    out: ndarray
        Output array.

    Examples
    --------
    > var x = {{alias:@stdlib/ndarray/base/zeros}}( 'float64', [ 2, 2 ], 'row-major' )
    <ndarray>[ [ 0.0, 0.0 ], [ 0.0, 0.0 ] ]
    > var y = {{alias}}( x, 1.0 )
    <ndarray>[ [ 1.0, 1.0 ], [ 1.0, 1.0 ] ]

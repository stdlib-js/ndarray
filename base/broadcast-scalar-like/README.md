## Usage

```javascript
var broadcastScalarLike = require( '@stdlib/ndarray/base/broadcast-scalar-like' );
```

#### broadcastScalarLike( x, value )

Broadcasts a scalar value to an [ndarray][@stdlib/ndarray/base/ctor] having the same shape and [data type][@stdlib/ndarray/dtypes] as a provided input [ndarray][@stdlib/ndarray/base/ctor].

```javascript
var zeros = require( '@stdlib/ndarray/base/zeros' );
var getDType = require( '@stdlib/ndarray/dtype' );

var x = zeros( 'float32', [ 2, 2 ], 'row-major' );
// returns <ndarray>[ [ 0.0, 0.0 ], [ 0.0, 0.0 ] ]

var y = broadcastScalarLike( x, 1.0 );
// returns <ndarray>[ [ 1.0, 1.0 ], [ 1.0, 1.0 ] ]

var dt = String( getDType( y ) );
// returns 'float32'
```

## Notes

-   Along with data type, shape, and order, the function infers the "class" of the returned [ndarray][@stdlib/ndarray/base/ctor] from the provided [ndarray][@stdlib/ndarray/base/ctor]. For example, if provided a "base" [ndarray][@stdlib/ndarray/base/ctor], the function returns a base [ndarray][@stdlib/ndarray/base/ctor]. If provided a non-base [ndarray][@stdlib/ndarray/ctor], the function returns a non-base [ndarray][@stdlib/ndarray/ctor].
-   If `value` is a number and the [data type][@stdlib/ndarray/dtypes] of the input ndarray is a complex [data type][@stdlib/ndarray/dtypes], the function returns an [ndarray][@stdlib/ndarray/base/ctor] containing a complex number whose real component equals the provided scalar `value` and whose imaginary component is zero.
-   The returned [ndarray][@stdlib/ndarray/base/ctor] is a view on an [ndarray][@stdlib/ndarray/base/ctor] data buffer containing a single element. The view is **not** contiguous. As more than one element of a returned view may refer to the same memory location, writing to the view may affect multiple elements. If you need to write to the returned [ndarray][@stdlib/ndarray/base/ctor], copy the [ndarray][@stdlib/ndarray/base/ctor] **before** performing operations which may mutate elements.

## Examples

<!-- eslint no-undef: "error" -->

```javascript
var dtypes = require( '@stdlib/ndarray/dtypes' );
var empty = require( '@stdlib/ndarray/base/empty' );
var broadcastScalarLike = require( '@stdlib/ndarray/base/broadcast-scalar-like' );

// Get a list of data types:
var dt = dtypes( 'integer_and_generic' );

// Generate broadcasted arrays...
var x;
var y;
var i;
for ( i = 0; i < dt.length; i++ ) {
    x = empty( dt[ i ], [ 2, 2 ], 'row-major' );
    y = broadcastScalarLike( x, i );
    console.log( y.get( 0, 0 ) );
}
```

# maybeBroadcastArrayExceptDimensions

> Broadcast an [ndarray][@stdlib/ndarray/base/ctor] to a specified shape while keeping a list of specified dimensions unchanged if and only if the specified shape differs from the provided [ndarray][@stdlib/ndarray/base/ctor]'s shape.

## Usage

<!-- eslint-disable id-length -->

```javascript
var maybeBroadcastArrayExceptDimensions = require( '@stdlib/ndarray/base/maybe-broadcast-array-except-dimensions' );
```

#### maybeBroadcastArrayExceptDimensions( arr, shape, dims )

Broadcasts an [ndarray][@stdlib/ndarray/base/ctor] to a specified shape while keeping a list of specified dimensions unchanged if and only if the specified shape differs from the provided [ndarray][@stdlib/ndarray/base/ctor]'s shape.

<!-- eslint-disable id-length -->

```javascript
var array = require( '@stdlib/ndarray/array' );

// Create a 2x2 ndarray:
var x = array( [ [ 1, 2 ], [ 3, 4 ] ] );
// returns <ndarray>[ [ 1, 2 ], [ 3, 4 ] ]

// Perform broadcasting:
var y = maybeBroadcastArrayExceptDimensions( x, [ 3, 2, 2 ], [ -1 ] );
// returns <ndarray>[ [ [ 1, 2 ], [ 3, 4 ] ], [ [ 1, 2 ], [ 3, 4 ] ], [ [ 1, 2 ], [ 3, 4 ] ] ]
```

The function accepts the following arguments:

-   **arr**: input [ndarray][@stdlib/ndarray/base/ctor].
-   **shape**: target shape.
-   **dims**: list of dimensions to exclude from broadcasting. Should be a list of negative integers.

## Notes

-   The function throws an error if a provided [ndarray][@stdlib/ndarray/base/ctor] is [incompatible][@stdlib/ndarray/base/broadcast-shapes] with a provided shape.
-   If a provided [ndarray][@stdlib/ndarray/base/ctor] has the same shape as the specified shape (excluding the list of specified dimensions), the function returns the provided [ndarray][@stdlib/ndarray/base/ctor].
-   If a provided [ndarray][@stdlib/ndarray/base/ctor] has a different (broadcast compatible) shape than the specified shape, the function returns a new (base) [ndarray][@stdlib/ndarray/base/ctor] view of the provided [ndarray][@stdlib/ndarray/base/ctor]'s data. The view is typically **not** contiguous. As more than one element of a returned view may refer to the same memory location, writing to the view may affect multiple elements. If you need to write to the returned [ndarray][@stdlib/ndarray/base/ctor], copy the [ndarray][@stdlib/ndarray/base/ctor] **before** performing operations which may mutate elements.
-   If a provided [ndarray][@stdlib/ndarray/base/ctor] does not have the same shape as the specified shape (excluding the list of specified dimensions), the returned [ndarray][@stdlib/ndarray/base/ctor] is a "base" [ndarray][@stdlib/ndarray/base/ctor], and, thus, the returned [ndarray][@stdlib/ndarray/base/ctor] does not perform bounds checking or afford any of the guarantees of the non-base [ndarray][@stdlib/ndarray/ctor] constructor. The primary intent of this function is to broadcast an ndarray-like object within internal implementations and to do so with minimal overhead.

## Examples

<!-- eslint no-undef: "error" -->

```javascript
var array = require( '@stdlib/ndarray/array' );
var numel = require( '@stdlib/ndarray/base/numel' );
var ind2sub = require( '@stdlib/ndarray/ind2sub' );
var getShape = require( '@stdlib/ndarray/shape' );
var maybeBroadcastArrayExceptDimensions = require( '@stdlib/ndarray/base/maybe-broadcast-array-except-dimensions' );

// Create a 1x3 array:
var x = array( [ [ 1, 2, 3 ] ] );
// returns <ndarray>[ [ 1, 2, 3 ] ]

// Broadcast the array to 2x1x3:
var y = maybeBroadcastArrayExceptDimensions( x, [ 2, 2, 3 ], [ -2 ] );
// returns <ndarray>[ [ [ 1, 2, 3 ] ], [ [ 1, 2, 3 ] ] ]

// Retrieve the shape:
var sh = getShape( y );
// returns [ 2, 1, 3 ]

// Retrieve the number of elements:
var N = numel( sh );

// Loop through the array elements...
var sub;
var v;
var i;
for ( i = 0; i < N; i++ ) {
    v = y.iget( i );
    sub = ind2sub( sh, i );
    console.log( 'Y[%s] = %d', sub.join( ', ' ), v );
}

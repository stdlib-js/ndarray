## Usage

```javascript
var toUniqueNormalizedIndices = require( '@stdlib/ndarray/base/to-unique-normalized-indices' );
```

#### toUniqueNormalizedIndices( indices, max )

Returns a list of unique indices after normalizing to the interval `[0,max]`.

```javascript
var idx = toUniqueNormalizedIndices( [ 2, -5 ], 10 );
// returns [ 2, 6 ]
```

If provided an out-of-bounds index, the function returns `null`.

```javascript
var idx = toUniqueNormalizedIndices( [ 15, -15 ], 10 );
// returns null
```

## Notes

-   During normalization, a negative index is converted to a nonnegative index according to `max + idx + 1`. If, after normalization, the resolved index is still negative, the value is considered out-of-bounds.
-   When provided valid indices, the function always returns a "generic" array.
-   The function preserves provided index order.

## Examples

<!-- eslint no-undef: "error" -->

```javascript
var discreteUniform = require( '@stdlib/random/array/discrete-uniform' );
var toUniqueNormalizedIndices = require( '@stdlib/ndarray/base/to-unique-normalized-indices' );

// Generate a list of random indices:
var idx = discreteUniform( 100, -15, 15, {
    'dtype': 'generic'
});
console.log( idx );

// Generate a list of unique indices normalized to the interval `[0, 15]`:
var out = toUniqueNormalizedIndices( idx, 15 );
console.log( out );
```

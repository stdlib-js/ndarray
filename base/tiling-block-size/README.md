## Usage

```javascript
var blockSize = require( '@stdlib/ndarray/base/tiling-block-size' );
```

#### blockSize( dtypes )

Resolves a loop block size for multi-dimensional array tiled loops according to provided ndarray [data types][@stdlib/ndarray/dtypes].

```javascript
var bsize = blockSize( [ 'float64', 'float64', 'float64', 'float64' ] );
// returns <number>
```

The function supports the following arguments:

-   **dtypes**: list of input and output ndarray [data types][@stdlib/ndarray/dtypes].

## Examples

```javascript
var dtypes = require( '@stdlib/ndarray/dtypes' );
var cartesianPower = require( '@stdlib/array/base/cartesian-power' );
var promoteDataTypes = require( '@stdlib/ndarray/base/promote-dtypes' );
var blockSize = require( '@stdlib/ndarray/base/tiling-block-size' );

// Generate a list of input ndarray dtype triplets:
var dt = cartesianPower( dtypes(), 3 );

// Resolve the block size for each dtype triplet and its promoted dtype...
var t;
var b;
var i;
console.log( 'block_size, xdtype, ydtype, zdtype, wdtype' );
for ( i = 0; i < dt.length; i++ ) {
    t = promoteDataTypes( dt[ i ] );
    dt[ i ].push( ( t === null ) ? 'generic' : t );
    b = blockSize( dt[ i ] );
    console.log( '%d, %s, %s, %s, %s', b, dt[i][0], dt[i][1], dt[i][2], dt[i][3] );
}
